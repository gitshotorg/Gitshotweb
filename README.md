# Gitshot
> **Real Developers. Real Tokens. Verified on Solana.**

## 🚀 Introduction

Web3 is full of promise—but for many, it's also full of impersonators, scammers, and copycat projects. People lose funds to fakes. Real builders see their reputation hijacked by opportunists. Trust suffers, innovation stalls.

**Gitshot** redraws that line using what Web3 has never had: verifiable software provenance, linked to your real GitHub identity.

- Every token launch requires verified *GitHub authentication*.
- No fakes. No proxies. No anonymous deployers.
- Each launch is publicly connected to a provable codebase & developer profile.
- Scammers are locked out by design. Developers finally own their builds and rewards.

**Gitshot** ties digital asset deployment directly to your GitHub credentials. Your commits, contributions, and repo history become the backbone of project legitimacy. Users gain transparency; developers reclaim agency—and the rewards.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Connect GitHub Account**  
   _OAuth required — establish legitimacy with your contribution record._

2. **Launch Token/Project on Solana**  
   _All metadata and signatures link back to your GitHub identity._

3. **Transparent for Users**
   _Your project’s provenance and source are visible and auditable._

4. **Earn Supports**
   _Build your token economy. Let your community back your real work!_

## 🛡️ The Problem

Web3’s biggest headache? **Fake devs.**  
Impersonators muddy the waters, steal credit, and undermine trust. Devs pour their soul into OSS, but get nothing back—or worse, see their reputation trashed by scams.

### Gitshot's Solution

- **No token deployed without your authenticated GitHub ID**
- **No launch without an auditable code history**
- _For the first time, your code is your on-chain passport. Users see *exactly* who’s responsible for every token._
